In ES6 

1.template literals =>  `${name}`

2.destructuring the objects:{
    example: 
    const player = {
        name: "Prabhu",
        age: "19",
        address:{
            city: "chennai"
        }
    }
}

destructured to =>

const{ name,age,address:{city} } = player;

we can access by 
console.log(`${name}`);
